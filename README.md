# BiocKubeInstall

Internal Bioconductor package used to create binaries for docker
images produced by Bioconductor. The package installation and binary
creation is parallelized on a Kubernetes cluster launched (at the
moment) on a Kubernetes cluster using GKE.

The package works in sync with the `Bioconductor/k8sredis` kubernetes
application.

## Quickstart 

Coming soon....
