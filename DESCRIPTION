Description: Build binaries for packages in R / Bioconductor using a
	     Kubernetes Cluster. The package is internal to
	     Bioconductor, and is used to create binaries for Docker
	     images produced by Bioconductor. The package has
	     potential to be extended to be used on Clusters created
	     on other cloud services like azure / aws, but right now a
	     lot of the functionality is specific to the Google
	     Cloud. This package goes together with the
	     `Bioconductor/k8sredis` kubernetes application. It does
	     not work stand alone.
