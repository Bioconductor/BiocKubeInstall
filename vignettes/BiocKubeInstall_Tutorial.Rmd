abstract: |
  The BiocKubeInstall package is a cloud computing resource meant to be
  used with Kubernetes. The package is used to create binaries for
  R and Bioconductor packages on specific docker images created by
  Bioconductor. It works in concert with k8sredis - the Kubernetes
  application and RedisParam package that parallelizes over a
  Kubernetes cluster. The package requires knowledge of the google
  cloud, kubernetes, and binary package creation. It is an internal
  package to Bioconductor used to make creation and  maintainence
  of package binaries easier and faster.
